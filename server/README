server code will go here,

IMPORTANT NOTE
in my testing file i have included
import com.jcraft.jsch.Channel;
import com.jcraft.jsch.ChannelSftp;
import com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException;
import com.jcraft.jsch.Session;

these may not all be actually required.


SUMMARY:

i have put the jar in here that contains the "oneshot.java" class
this class can create a connection to a ssh server and connect two streams
that you pass to it to the input and output for the server.

it also contains a function "openSFTP" which opens an sftp connection and
returns a object that can perform functions via the sftp connection.


=================================================================================

the useful functions are

=================================================================================

public Void StartShell(String host,String passwd, InputStream in, PrintStream out)

IMPORTANT NOTE host is a string formated as so "james@dwtj.me" or "<username>@<host>"

for all of my testing i used System.in and System.out for the last 2 inputs


=================================================================================


public ChannelSftp openSFTP(String host, int PORT, String passwd)

IMPORTANT NOTE 
host is a string formated as so "james@dwtj.me" or "<username>@<host>"

this function returns a ChannelSftp

which is documented here:
