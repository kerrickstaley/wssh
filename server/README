server code will go here,

i have put the jar in here that contains the "oneshot.java" class
this class can create a connection to a ssh server and connect two streams
that you pass to it to the input and output for the server.

the useful function is

public Void StartShell(String host,String passwd, InputStream in, PrintStream out)


//this method may return an object of type channel but it is not used.
//this method may throw exceptions.
IMPORTANT NOTE host is a string formated as so "james@dwtj.me" or "<username>@<host>"

for all of my testing i used System.in and System.out for the last 2 inputs
